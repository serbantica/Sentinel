# Sentinel

**Human-AI Mental Health Companion System**

FastAPI-based GenAI MVP app with FAISS and OpenAI, designed to provide emotional support, crisis detection, and mental wellness assistance.

## Project Focus

Sentinel is a two-layer mental health companion system:
- **Layer 1:** Community wellness platform for everyday emotional support
- **Layer 2:** Clinical support bridge connecting users with mental health professionals

See [Sentinel_proposal_v2.md](Sentinel_proposal_v2.md) and [Sentinel_Roadmap_v2.md](Sentinel_Roadmap_v2.md) for detailed project documentation.

## Important Note: Docs Folder

The `Docs/` folder contains proposals for a **different product** (AI Companion Orchestration Platform for elderly care). These proposals are **not part of Sentinel** and should be implemented in a separate repository.

See [DOCS_ANALYSIS.md](DOCS_ANALYSIS.md) for a comprehensive analysis and recommendation.

## Current Status

Early development stage - project structure established, implementation in progress.
