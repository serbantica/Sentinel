# Sentinel

**Human-AI Mental Health Companion System**

FastAPI-based GenAI MVP app with FAISS and OpenAI, designed to provide emotional support, crisis detection, and mental wellness assistance.

## Project Focus

Sentinel is a two-layer mental health companion system:
- **Layer 1:** Community wellness platform for everyday emotional support
- **Layer 2:** Clinical support bridge connecting users with mental health professionals

See [Sentinel_proposal_v2.md](Sentinel_proposal_v2.md) and [Sentinel_Roadmap_v2.md](Sentinel_Roadmap_v2.md) for detailed project documentation.

## Repository Separation: AI Nanny (Docs Moved)

The `Docs/` folder previously contained proposals for a **different product** (AI Companion Orchestration Platform for elderly care). These proposals are **not part of Sentinel** and have been moved to prepare for a separate repository.

### What Happened
- Documentation moved to staging area: [migrated/ai-nanny-docs/](migrated/ai-nanny-docs/)
- Target repository: **serbantica/ai-nanny** (to be created)
- See [DOCS_ANALYSIS.md](DOCS_ANALYSIS.md) for why these projects are separate
- See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for git commands to migrate with history
- See [SEPARATION_NEXT_STEPS.md](SEPARATION_NEXT_STEPS.md) for exact migration steps

## Current Status

Early development stage - project structure established, implementation in progress.
